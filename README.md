# spme-comparison

A comparison of the terminal voltage predicted by the SPMe [1], DFN, SP, and cSP [2] models.

The script uses the open-source battery modelling software [PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM). To install the appropriate version of PyBaMM, run:
```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/pybamm-team/pybamm.git@csp-updated#egg=pybamm
```
